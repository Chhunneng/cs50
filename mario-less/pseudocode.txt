1. Prompt the user for the height
2. Validate the user input:
   - If the height is less than 1 or greater than 8 (or not an integer), go back to step 1
3. Iterate from 1 through height:
   a. Print spaces (height - i - 1 times) to center-align the pyramid
   b. Print hashes (i times) for the left half of the pyramid
   c. Move to the next line for the next row
4. End
