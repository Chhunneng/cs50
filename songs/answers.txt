Reflection on Audio Aura Calculation

1. Characterizing the Audio Aura:
   To characterize the audio aura based on the top 100 songs from 2018 in songs.db, we calculated the average energy, valence, and danceability of those songs. This was done to provide insights into the listener's mood as dictated by their favorite songs of that year.

   SQL Query:
```
SELECT AVG(energy) AS avg_energy, AVG(valence) AS avg_valence, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM songs
WHERE song_id IN (SELECT song_id FROM top_100_songs_2018 WHERE listener_id = 'listener_id_here');
```

2. Limitations and Potential Bias:
- Relying solely on the top 100 songs may not fully represent the listener's music taste, as it might exclude songs outside this list.
- The selected year (2018) may not be reflective of the listener's current preferences, and music tastes can evolve over time.
- The dataset may lack diversity in genres, potentially leading to a biased representation of the audio aura.
- The chosen features (energy, valence, danceability) are limited; there might be other relevant features not considered.

3. Proposed Improvements:
- Expand the dataset to include more than the top 100 songs, providing a more comprehensive view of the listener's music preferences.
- Include songs from multiple years to capture changes in musical taste over time.
- Incorporate additional features beyond energy, valence, and danceability, such as tempo, acousticness, or instrumentalness.
- Implement a weighting system considering the recency of a song or the number of times a song has been played.

Overall, while the current approach provides insights into the listener's mood based on their top songs, there are limitations that could be addressed to make the audio aura calculation more representative and nuanced.
